## Local-First Study Workspace

This fork extends the original lecture-to-notes app into a local-first study workspace. It can run with local transcription and local LLMs, process multiple lecture source types, and generate interactive learning materials from the combined lecture context.

### Added in This Fork

- **Local transcription** with Faster-Whisper.
- **Local text and vision models** through Ollama.
- **Multi-source lecture input**: audio, images, pasted text, PDF, DOCX, and PPTX.
- **Language preservation**: generated notes, quizzes, flashcards, and tasks stay in the lecture language.
- **Saved lecture library** with folders, open/delete actions, and automatic saving.
- **Interactive quizzes** with scoring, correct answers, and explanations.
- **Interactive flashcards** with flip/next/previous study flow.
- **Mini exams** with local AI grading for text or uploaded photo/file solutions.
- **Practice tasks workspace** with quick-answer tasks and photo/file solution tasks.
- **Right-side AI tutor** that can answer questions in lecture context and edit notes/quizzes/flashcards/exams.
- **Beautiful PDF export** for notes.

### Local Model Defaults

The app is configured to use:

- `llama3.1:8b` for local text generation through Ollama.
- `qwen2.5vl:7b` for local image understanding through Ollama.
- `medium` Faster-Whisper model for local audio transcription.

Install the Ollama models:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
ollama pull qwen2.5vl:7b
```

Run locally:

```bash
cd lecture-voice-to-notes
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8501
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Installation Issues

**Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'streamlit'`
```bash
# Solution
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Problem**: `Python version too old`
```bash
# Solution: Upgrade Python
# Visit https://www.python.org/downloads/
# Install Python 3.8 or higher
```

#### API Key Issues

**Problem**: `Invalid API key` or `Authentication failed`
```bash
# Solution 1: Check .env file
cat .env  # Linux/Mac
type .env  # Windows

# Solution 2: Verify key format
# Groq keys start with: gsk_
# OpenAI keys start with: sk-

# Solution 3: Re-enter key in app sidebar
```

**Problem**: `Rate limit exceeded` (OpenAI)
```bash
# Solution: Switch to Groq (FREE)
# Or wait and retry with OpenAI
# Or upgrade OpenAI plan
```

#### Audio Processing Issues

**Problem**: `Audio file too large`
```bash
# Solution 1: Compress audio
# Use Audacity or online tools to reduce file size

# Solution 2: Split long lectures
# Process in parts (e.g., 1-hour segments)

# Solution 3: Increase limit in config.py
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB = 50  # Increase if needed
```

**Problem**: `Poor transcription quality`
```bash
# Solutions:
# ✓ Use clear audio with minimal background noise
# ✓ Ensure speaker is close to microphone
# ✓ Remove music/sound effects from recording
# ✓ Try different AI model (Groq whisper-large-v3 is excellent)
```

#### FFmpeg Warning

**Warning**: `Couldn't find ffmpeg or avconv`
```bash
# This is optional - app works without FFmpeg
# To install (optional):

# Windows: 
# Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

# Mac:
brew install ffmpeg

# Linux:
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```
